# plan

I want you to review the code and come up with a basic plan for implementing this at a high level. You should reference relevant classes and methods, but not the code inside. Just give an English description of what there is to be done around these different places. If there's new stuff to be made, detail that, but again, don't actually write the interior code. We're just trying to frame all this. Put your results into a Markdown file under docs/plan.
